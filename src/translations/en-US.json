  "Levain hydration definition": [
    "The percentage of water compare to the flour in the levain. (ex: 160g of levain at 60% hydration actually has 100g of flour and 60g of water). Keeping the levain at around 60% is recommended as used by bakers since it's good for any type of bread dough (baguette, campagne bread dough, pizza) and helps for storage and tend to last longueur (but the calculus is more complicated).",
    "When adding the same among of water than flour in the levain, it's called 100% hydration.\n 100% hydration levain is considered as liquid,  it’s easier to calculate the among of water vs flour, provide lighter acidity in the bread and need more care (sensible to temperature, may create bread dough more sticky, need to be more nourished)"

  "Dough hydration definition": "Calculating all the hydration in the levain and bread dough helps to insure a good consistencies of the bread dough batter. A low hydration (60%) helps to have a dough that can easily be manipulate and will keep a good shape in the oven. In USA, since the flour tend to contain more proteins, it’s better to increase a bit the hydration."
